# Perfume Inspiration Finder

A feature-rich, single-page web application designed to help users explore and find inspiration for "dupe" perfumes available on the Shobi website ([leparfum.com.gr/en/](https://leparfum.com.gr/en/)).

This application is built with vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and several powerful libraries to provide a fast, beautiful, and user-friendly experience. It loads all its data from the external `parfumer_beriget_ai.json` file.

## Features

* **Dynamic Data Loading:** All perfume data is loaded asynchronously from a local JSON file, making it easy to update the collection.

* **Advanced Search & Filtering:**

  * A powerful real-time search that queries across all perfume attributes (brand, name, notes, etc.).

  * Filter by Brand, Perfume Type (Men, Women, Unisex, Niche), and multiple Scent Notes simultaneously using an intuitive combo box.

* **Dual View Modes:**

  * **Card View:** A responsive, visually appealing grid layout perfect for browsing.

  * **Table View:** A sortable and paginated table view powered by Grid.js, ideal for quickly analyzing and comparing data.

* **User-Centric Tools:**

  * **Favorites System:** Mark perfumes with a heart icon to save them to a personal list, which is stored locally in the browser.

  * **Shopping Cart:** Collect perfume codes in a slide-out cart.

  * **Copy Codes:** Easily copy all collected codes to the clipboard with a single click, ready to be used on the Shobi website.

* **Interactive Dashboard:**

  * Visualize the data with charts (powered by Chart.js) showing breakdowns of perfumes per brand and by scent type.

  * See interesting, dynamically calculated stats about the perfume collection.

* **Customizable Themes:**

  * Switch between four beautiful, pre-built color themes (Solarized Dark, Dracula, Nord, and Gruvbox Light) to suit your preference. Your choice is saved for your next visit.

* **Performance Optimized:**

  * The card view uses a "lazy loading" approach, initially displaying a subset of results and allowing the user to load more, ensuring a fast initial startup even with thousands of products.
